 This is a speed detector system
I am required to come up the the solution to the problem below

/*Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.*/


I will use :
=>HTML for my GUI
=>CSS for styling
=> Javascript for my backend
